# PY-CL-Lists

## Overview
This project demonstrates various operations on lists in Python. It includes functions to create lists, access elements, reverse lists, and combine multiple lists. The project also includes an entry point script (`app.py`) to interactively demonstrate the functionality, along with unit tests (`lab_test.py`) to ensure the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file serves as the main entry point for the project. It allows users to interactively test the list manipulation functions implemented in `lab.py`. Users can create lists, access elements, and perform other list operations through this script.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementations of various list manipulation functions. Each function is documented with instructions on how to use it and what it does. The functions include creating lists, accessing elements, reversing lists, and combining lists.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the functions defined in `lab.py`. It ensures that the implemented functions behave as expected by testing them with various input cases. The tests cover scenarios such as creating lists with valid and invalid inputs, accessing elements at different indices, and combining multiple lists.

    - lab_test.py


## Getting Started
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the list manipulation functions.
3. Follow the prompts to create lists, access elements, and perform other list operations.
4. Refer to the instructions provided in the docstrings of each function in `lab.py` for guidance on usage.

## Testing
1. Open the `src/test/lab_test.py` file.
2. Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
3. Ensure that all tests pass, indicating that the implemented functions are working correctly.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with list manipulation in Python. By exploring the functions in `lab.py` and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can enhance their understanding of lists and improve their Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
